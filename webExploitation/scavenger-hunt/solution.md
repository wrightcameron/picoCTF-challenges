# Scavenger Hunt
## Problem
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/. Can you find it?

## Notes
This challenge is very similar to insp3ct0r, parts of the key are in the css and html like last time.  Only thing different is the javascript has a comment saying it wants to disable google indexing.

Stumpted me for a while cause there are multiple ways to prevent indexing.
* Add meta data in html saying no indexing.
* Adding no indexing message in header
* Creating a robots.txt file at the root level of the web server.

I thought this no indexing would show up in the webpage with the debugger.  I then figured I had to request the robots.txt file myself.  So send this url *http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/robots.txt*, and get this response.

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html

# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

Without brute forcing I wonder if there is a way to get an index of all files on a webserver?

Yes, found out the concept is called Website enumeration, and this article [Ethical Hacking 101: Basic Web Enumeration](https://thebe0vlksaga.com/2019/03/31/ethical-hacking-101-web-server-enumeration) talks about using tool Gobuster.  I haven't downloaded this tool or will use it on this problem as it does sound like brute force method.  Though i'll have to follow up on this concept, or assume another challenge will.  Lastly the article also mentions checking out the robots.txt manually as it could contain other useful information about sub directories.

There is a 4th part of the flag...

Took some research into apache web servers and any other files that would be found on the webserver.  One article [Apache Web Server Hardening and Security Guide](https://geekflare.com/apache-web-server-hardening-security/) has alot of tips for hardening an Apache webserver, ... and testing it.

One of these mentions the meta file .htaccess can be overwritten.  Now I don't know how I can overwrite it but I can access it and with postman this file does return this result *http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/.htaccess*

```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```

I'll assume there is more to find, just cause this file mentions that this OS or site was developed on a mac.

Finding the last flag sucked.  I went with the assumption that a Mac apache webserver would have other meta files in the root directory that I could find, but no guide for setting up these files showed promise.  It wasn't til I looked back at the message in the .htaccess file, it has Store capitalized.

Searching for the Mac Store directory returned a result.  Macs keep a hidden files called .DS_Store and searching for that file *http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/.DS_Store* returned.

That hurt, cause I own a Mac and I have seen that file before.  But lesson gained is look for hidden files.  Mac and Windows sometimes generate them without telling you, or hidding them from you.

Also when setting up your own webserver, lock it down.

## Solution
HTML:  Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t 
CSS: /* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
robots.txt: Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
.htaccess: Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
.DS_Store: Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _d375c750}

picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_d375c750}
