# Some Assembly Required 1
## Problem
http://mercury.picoctf.net:15472/index.html

## Notes
The link leads to a webpage with a form asking for the flag, and some really cryptic javascript.  The only way to solve this problem is to piece together what the javascript does.  The javascript has all variables, numbers, and functions as hex values.  Changing those shows that alot of the code is accessing a list that contains fuctions, parts of the flag, and a file location.

The javascript also at one point jumbles the list, just to make the code much harder. Things to note about javascript.
* Fuction pointers are being used, the function is created named, but then another variable points to the fuction.
* A function of an object can be called and used like `randomList['push']`. Looks like a (in this case its also a list) list but the randomList would be the object, and push is the function that a list object has.  To pass parameters it would be `document['getElementById'](parameter)`
* A ternary condition is used, condition ? value : else value
* An object serialized is imported using fetch and instantiated with instantiate

While reviewing code, I noticed that at fetch is being used.  This fetch is reaches out to url *http://mercury.picoctf.net:15472/JIFxzHyW8W*.  This url returns a file containing binary.  I assume its a serilazed javascript object.  Just downloading it and viewing the contents shows that a string of the flag is visible.

This does mean I don't need to understand the rest of the javascript file to understand how the flag is found, though doing so would be good insight.

## Further questions.
1. Can I spin up a docker container webserver and use the javascript code I formated to run the debugger.
2. Use objdump and string to see if there is any way to view the binary file.
3. If not objdump or string command, see if there is a way to view this js serial objects function body.
