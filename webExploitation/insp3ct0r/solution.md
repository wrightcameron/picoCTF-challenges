# Insp3ct0r
## Problem
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: *https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/* (link) or *http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511*

## Links
*[link] (https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/)

## Notes
There are two links, 1 to a path that is also following REST guidlines "problem/41511" and the other that is a link to the same url but on port 41511.  Seems like the "problem/41511" redirects the request to the port, or maybe the otherway around port 41511 redirects to port 443 (https).

First part of the flag is located in a comment in the body, "Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3"

Second part of the flag is located in the css, "/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */"


Third part of the flag is located in a javascript comment, "Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?832b0699}"

All of these pieces were found using the Firefox debugger, and viewing the page source.

## Solution
picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}
