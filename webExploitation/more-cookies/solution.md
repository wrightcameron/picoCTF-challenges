# More Cookies

## Problem

I forgot Cookies can Be modified Client-side, so now I decided to encrypt them! http://mercury.picoctf.net:56136/

## Notes

First hint mentions [Homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption), meaning that maybe I don't have to decrypt the cookie, but I could still use it.

The encrypted cookie on this site is "TGRJdjBtckZtclRFSTdTelQxU0xpZ2lWOFZldHdtMytTQWZQRXpjQlUwQ0VTR2tIaVFHRWVwN2pxQVBQZHFBenJheEhjdUdZTHdJN1AzWVE2WndhV0t0enl5YlFLdzdvTHlZdlRYUklaOXRFbkhzNHc4bHNzR3AwWG5tUmJBcVY".

In the problem the CBC are capitolized, if looking up CBC encryption there are results on [Cipher Block Chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_\(CBC).
