# Login

## Problem

My dog-sitter's brother made this website but I can't get in; can you help? *login.mars.picoctf.net*

## Notes

First observation is the site is https, this doesn't seem important but is interesting as every site before this has been http.

The login password verification is being done client side, I can see that the javascript is in a async function.  The function atob() is used before showing the password.  This says that it decodes a Base64 encoding, so the flag should be in here and I can use the same function in the firefox debugger.

## Solution

The javascript needs to compare the encoded base64 hash it makes from a username and password I put in with the correct encoded flag.  I can see this is done when a value t.p is compared with a string of random characters to check if they are not the same.  If they are not the same it tells the user incorrect password.

If I take that jumble of text and use the atob() function I get the flag.

```js
atob("cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ")
```

Returns the flag: picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}
