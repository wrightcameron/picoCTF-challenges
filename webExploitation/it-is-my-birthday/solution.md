# It is my Birthday

## Problem

I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDF to my website. *http://mercury.picoctf.net:20277/*

## Notes

The md5 algorithm is for creating a hash of a file/text/binary, and it is no longer used due to having hash collisions.  I didn't know this but by default there is a command on Ubuntu preinstalled called `md5sum`.  This command is great for generating hashes, and for this problem checking if the two files do have the same hash.

I used this Stack Overflow question for help, [Create your own MD5 collisions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/933497/create-your-own-md5-collisions).  A response linked two Postscript files, and they did result in a hash collision.  I downloaded these two files and renamed the file type to PDF.  Uploading them to the pico site resulted in the answer.  The main response said that blocks

would result in a collision, but just copying them into a text file didn't result in any.  I do want to come back to this problem and see if I could create the collision. My first thought would be to turn them into binary instead of leaving them as ASCII.

## Solution

The site requests that 2 PDF are submitted and checked to see if your are invited to the party.  The problem mentions that both PDF will have a md5 collision so any two files with the same md5 hash collision will do.  The site only thinks a file is a PDF if it ends in .PDF, so how I solved this problem was find two files that showed to have the same hash and submitted them.  I used the Linux command `md5sum <file>` to check its hash.

If the files are different but have the same hash, the entire PHP syntax and flag are shown.
