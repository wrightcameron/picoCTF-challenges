## Problem
Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary

## Notes
Converting the binary can be as simple as dividing the number by the largest binary number that would go into our decimal.  Then take the remainder and go through the smaller binary numbers.

42/32= 10
10/8 = 2
2/2/ 0

All the binary numbers I didn't use would be 0, so (32) 1, (16) 0, (8) 1, (4) 0, (2) 1, (1) 0

## Solution
The binary of 42 is.
