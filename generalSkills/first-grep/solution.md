# First Grep
## Problem
Can you find the flag in *file*? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

## Links
* [flag](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/495d43ee4a2b9f345a4307d053b4d88d/file)

## Solution
Use the grep command, didn't even need any special flags.
