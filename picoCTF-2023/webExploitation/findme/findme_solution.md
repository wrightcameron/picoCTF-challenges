## Problem

Help us test the form by submiting the username as `test` and password as `test!`

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Notes

Opening up the website leads to a login page that only works with the creds `test/test!`.  The next page just has a text input field that says "Search for Flag".  Hitting submit has the page reload the exactly the same.  

```html
  <body>
    <section>
      <h1 style="margin-top:5px">Welcome fellow Human</h1>
      <hr class="thin">
      <form id="search-form" onsubmit="return search()">
        <input id="keyword" type="text" class="thin" placeholder="Search for flags"><button type="submit" class="thin">Go</button></form>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section id="search-result">
      You searched for <span id="search-term"></span>
      <p>Waiting for server's response... lol</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>I was redirected here by a friend of mine but i couldnt find anything. Help me search for flags :-)</p>
    </section>

  </body>
```

The source code for this form also shows a javascript function running.

```js
function search() {
        const searchResult = document.getElementById("search-result");
        const searchTerm = document.getElementById("search-term");
        const keyword = document.getElementById("keyword");
        const comments = document.getElementById("comments");
        comments.style.visibility = "hidden";
        searchResult.style.display = "block";
        searchTerm.innerHTML = keyword.value;
        //fetching results related to the keyword value from the server
        return false;
```

The script doesn't work, it says comments is null.  Cause their is not HTML element that has a comment id.

### ~~ETag~~

In the header of the `/home`, there appears to be an [ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag).

*This was a false lead*

### Firefox debuggger

The login page was redirecting to two pages before it gets to home.  These two pages would use built in javascript to force the next one in the chain to load.

These can be seen with the FIrefox debugger Network tab.  Here if the logs are set to presist even page refreshes won't remove any calls.  From the top should be the login page and the two redircts are.

1. `/next-page/id=cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs`
2. `/next-page/id=bF90aGVfd2F5X2EwZmUwNzRmfQ==`

These look like Base64, and with this simple command,

```bash
$ echo "cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs" | base64 --decode
picoCTF{proxies_alc
$ echo "bF90aGVfd2F5X2EwZmUwNzRmfQ==" | base64 --decode
l_the_way_a0fe074f}
```

The flag has been found.

## Solution

icoCTF{proxies_alcl_the_way_a0fe074f}

*Flag may be different for others due to active competition.*
