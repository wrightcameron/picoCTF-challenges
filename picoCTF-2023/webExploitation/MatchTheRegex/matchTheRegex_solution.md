# MatchTheRegex

## Problem

How about trying to match a regular expression

## Notes

Challange leads to site with a simple input form with submit.  Opening up the source shows a page with an embedded javascript for sending the text to a api route for verifcation.

```js
function send_request() {
		let val = document.getElementById("name").value;
		// ^p.....F!?
		fetch(`/flag?input=${val}`)
			.then(res => res.text())
			.then(res => {
				const res_json = JSON.parse(res);
				alert(res_json.flag)
				return false;
			})
		return false;
```

Trying to figure out the solution involving regex is easy when a comment `// ^p.....F!?` is left in.  This regex is mostly a string that starts with p, allows any character in the middle, and then ends with a F!.

Passing in something that would be found by that results in the flag.
