# rotation

## Problem

You will find the flag after decrypting this file Download the encrypted flag [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/390/encrypted.txt).

## Notes

The name rotation in a cryptography challange should make it seem like a ROT13 cipher.  Using site [cyberchef](https://cyberchef.org) and selecting ROT13 I quickly went through the different combinations till ROT18 sovled the puzzle.

ciphers like this are always easy when the first part of the flag `picoCTF` is always known

## Solution

picoCTF{r0tat1on_d3crypt3d_429af00f}

*Flag may be different for others due to active competition.*
