# ReadMyCert

## Problem

How about we take you on an adventure on exploring certificate signing requests Take a look at this CSR file [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/421/readmycert.csr).

## Notes

The csr file when download can be opened with Gnome.  The file shows the Identity as picoCTF{read_mycert_3aa80090}.  Opening the file with vim just shows the public key so having Gnome show this information by default is nice and makes this challange easy.

## Solution

picoCTF{read_mycert_3aa80090}
