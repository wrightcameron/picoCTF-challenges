# What's a Net Cat
## Problem
Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 64287 to get the flag?

## Notes
Used command `$ nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 64287`

## Solution
This problem was easier than nice-cat, it gave the flag when connected to with nc
picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_284be8f7}
