# Lets Warm Up
## Problem
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII? 

## Notes
`man ascii` makes life easier

## Solution
`$ man ascii` will show you the ASCII table, find 70 under hex and find what letter that refers too.  It turns out the flag just wants the first letter so that is all you need, don't really need to make a script to automate that.
