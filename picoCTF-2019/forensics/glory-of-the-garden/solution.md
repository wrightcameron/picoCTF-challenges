# Glory of the Garden

## Problem

This [garden](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/43c4743b3946f427e883f6b286f47467/garden.jpg) contains more than it seems.

## Links

## Solution

The link in the challange leads to a jpg, this jpg is an image of a lush garden.

Before using Linux tools to try to find meta data the first thing I do is just vim the file.  Looking through the file is static text, including the flag picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3657BaB2C}
