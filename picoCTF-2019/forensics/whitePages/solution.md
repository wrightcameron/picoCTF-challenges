# WhitePages

## Problem

I stopped using YellowPages and moved onto WhitePages... but [the page they gave me](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/74274b96fe966126a1953c80762af80d/whitepages.txt) is all blank!

## Notes

The file downloaded is true to its name, its completely blank.  So this problem is good to open up in VScode cause the find feature allows easy use of regex.  /s, /t, and /n are all considered whitespace but could be hidden through out the message.

Searching on /s highlights the entire file, while tab and new line don't show anything.  But it seems searching for spaces as hitting enter once does show some of the characters are selected but not all of them.  These can be replaced with 1.  The ohter symbol which I don't know what it is can be 0.

```

Taking this collection of 1s and 0s to [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/), and converting from binary shows an ascii message.

```

## Solution

There are two types of whitespace, the one from hitting enter and some other one.  Simply replacing the enter spaces with 1s and the other with 0s gives a binary message.  Turning this binary into ascii results in a message that shows the flag.  The flag is picoCTF{not_all_spaces_are_created_equal_c54f27cd05c2189f8147cc6f5deb2e56}
