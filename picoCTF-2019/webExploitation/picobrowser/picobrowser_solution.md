## Solution

The website tells me that I need to be using the picobrowser.  And if I click on the flag button in Firefox it just tells me that I am using Firefox.  A website knows what browser you are using from the request HTTP header User-Agent.  Using Postman I can change the user agent to picobrowser.

The response from changing the User Agent is a html page with the flag included.  The flag is picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_e9b160d0}
