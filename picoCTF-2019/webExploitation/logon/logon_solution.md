# logon

## Problem

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? *http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:13594*

## Notes

I don't see any javascript on this page, it appears that the buttons and form are calling routes.  A /, /logout, and /login.  Might as well call them myself with postman.

Caling the route login just shows the static page, I did try logging in as Joe and with a wrong password it just has a error message mocking you for trying.

At this point I was trying to think of ways to brute force find what the password is, after all it can't be too secure when only one user has their password authenticated.

Thankfully I didn't have to do that as looking at the cookies in the request while logged in showed plain text fields like admin I could modify.

## Solution

The site when you login gives you cookies, there are three.  The first 2 are your username and password.  The third is a boolean field called admin.  Changing the admin field to True and refreshing the page shows the flag.
