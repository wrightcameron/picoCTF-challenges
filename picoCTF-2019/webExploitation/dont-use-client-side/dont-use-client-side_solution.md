# Don't Use Client Side

## Problem

Can you break into this super secure portal? *http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:37821*

## Solution

It's obvious from the name that this challenge will be about come client side validation.  Opening up the page shows a login page, opening up the plaintext html shows a javascript function with the flag jumpled in code.

Without reverse engineering the js too much, you can see that the order the flag should be in is the same as 0 though split*9. So order the strings from 0 though 9.
