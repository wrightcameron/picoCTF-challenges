## Notes

This challange is an easier version of challange Scavenger Hunt.  Instead of looking for multiple obects you only need to find 2 files.  Use notes on Scavenger Hunt to solve this problem.

## Solution

The name of the challange tips you off to look for the robots.txt file.

```bash
curl http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474/robots.txt
```

That will return the contents of the robots.txt file, which contains a file name */477ce.html*, doing another curl command to that file name results in a static page containing the flag

Flag: picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}
