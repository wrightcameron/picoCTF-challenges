# Flags

## Problem

What do the [flags](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/fbeb5f9040d62b18878d199cdda2d253/flag.png) mean?

* [flags](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/fbeb5f9040d62b18878d199cdda2d253/flag.png)

## Notes

Downloading the flag.png, it appears to be the *picoCTF{XXXX}* flag but using flags except for { }.  The flags almost look like they are from a custom font found in Microsoft Word.  Some of the flags repeat, and it seems that each flag corosponds with one letter.  in picoCTF, both the c use the same flag.

Google search of flag "yellow background black circle" resulted in a flag for no surfing in California.  No results.

The "white background red diamond" flag did turn up a result, its the ICS Flag for Foxtrot.

### International Code of Signals

The [International Code of Signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Signals) is an international set of signals and codes for ships.  Each of the flags corrisponds with a letter.  One the wikipedia page there is a chart with each flag representing which letter.

## Solution

Using the ICS flag chart, the flag decoded is, picoCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}}, the places with underscores originally were hard to find cause there was no letter flags that matched the flags.  But the number flag for 5 matched, and 1 for some reason didn't but it didn't take many guesses to figure 1 looks like an L.
