## Notes
On first glance there is nothing in the html, css, no javascript on this webpage.  For this I used the firefox debugger, great tool for viewing source, javascript, and the network.  The trick with this problem is when I click on any of the buttons the color changes, this color change happens by the html form sending its input.  There are two inputs, one for blue and one for red.

My first thought was this was a request where the form is sending the input as parameters in the url, but the input didn't have an id so I didn't know what it would be submitted as.  Worse, when I change the input to Green, the page turns white with no hidden flag in the html.  The problem with this site is when clicking on the buttons the network debugger tab shows the request but the response view is bugged it shows nothing.  So I switched to using tool postman to try to send the requests.  Postman is a tool for testing urls and APIs.  With postman I sent the commands but didn't see any results.

On further view of the html of the page I finally noticed that the two forms are sending different requests, the first one is GET and the second is POST. This is where the break through happens, I can use postman to easily go through all the request types.  Working through most of the types I noticed no different changes to the html except for the HEAD request.  That got me thinking of the header and sure enough the header for the HEAD request had the flag as an attribute.

Using the firefox debugger, I can make the same request by resending the request for the page as a GET into a HEAD and view the header attribute too.

## Solution
Connecting to the url with a HEAD request shows the flag as an attribute in the header.

picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_82880908}

## Further Testing
I can use the curl command to get the same flag, will need to test further if I can view the header with the GET request or to try other requests.
`$curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/index.php? --head`
