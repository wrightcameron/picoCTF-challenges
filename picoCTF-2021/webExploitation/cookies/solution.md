# Cookies
## Problem
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. *http://mercury.picoctf.net:21485/*

## Notes
Very obvious, the flag is going to be located around modifying or viewing the site cookie.  This site asks you for your favorite cookie, then responds back telling you that cookie is valid and not very special.  The cookie generated is just a number, starting at -1 and changes to 0 for snickerdoodle.  I can use either the firefox debugger or postman to change the cookie and resend the response, though both are kind of tedius.  I was unable to find the flag from 0 through 29.  Any higher number to my best knowledge doesn't relate to a cookie.  I need to automate this, changing the cookie quickly and quickly scanning the results.  Though I don't know if the cookie is going to come through body or the header.

Postman can generate the same code it uses to send the request.  So for python I could start with this.

```python
import requests

url = "http://mercury.picoctf.net:21485/check"

payload={}
headers = {
  'Cookie': 'name=0'
}

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
```

Starting there I would put that request into a loop and quickly loop through -5 through 30.  In this loop I would check if the body or header changes based on what it looks like for any other cookie.

I started with header, checking if the header size changed at all besides 3.  From this check there was a hit, cookie #18 has a header with only two attributes its missing *Set-Cookie: session=; Expires=Thu, 01-Jan-1970 00:00:00 GMT; Max-Age=0; Path=/*.  The flag was shown in the body.

## Solution
Flag shown in body of html, when cookie sent is 18.  Flag: picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_94190c8a}
