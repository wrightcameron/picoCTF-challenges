# Some Assembly Required 2

## Problem

*http://mercury.picoctf.net:48841/index.html*

## Notes

Just like "Some Assembly Required 1, this problem is going to be analyzing a javascript file that is very cryptic.  With names changed to hex values and it all bunched up.

The first thing I will look at is for a link to another page, as with the first challange the solution was in a serialized json object that is on its own route.

Apparently this one also does have the same thing, but I don't see the flag as text in this binary/serialized js object.
