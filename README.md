# PicoCTF Challange Solutions

## About

PicoCTF is a Capture the Flag site hosted by [Carnegi Mellon University](https://picoctf.org).  These challanges include Web Exploitation, Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Forensics, General Skills, and Binary Exploitation.

This repository is for solutions and scripts I have come up with to solve the variety of challanges.

## Build

Some problems require the donwnload of files from picoctf.org.  These files are not being hosted in this repository but they can be easily downloaded from the challanges themselves on picoctf.org or using the make file in solution directories.

### Setting up challange

```bash
make
```

### Cleaning up challenge

```bash
make clean
```
